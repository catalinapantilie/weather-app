# weather-app
This is a weather application made in JS, HTML and CSS. 
I used an API from https://openweathermap.org. I tried to make a friendley interface which provide information about temp, humidity and wind from a city.
Also I update the image, class = weather-icon, according to the conditions obtain from object.weather[0].main: clouds, clear, rain, drizzle, mist, snow.
